# Optimizing Solidity Compiler

**solx** is a new optimizing compiler for EVM developed by [Matter Labs](https://matter-labs.io/) and [Nomic Foundation](https://nomic.foundation/).

> [!WARNING]  
> The project is in beta and must be used with caution. Please use it only for testing and experimentation.
> If you want to use it in production, make sure to test your contracts thoroughly, or [contact us](#contact-us) first.

**solx** passes multiple test suites, including:

- [Foundry projects](./solx-dev/foundry-tests.toml)
- [Hardhat projects](./solx-dev/hardhat-tests.toml)
- [other projects](./tests/solidity/complex/defi) such as UniswapV2 and Mooniswap
- [tests](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/solx-solidity/tree/0.8.33/test/libsolidity/semanticTests) from the **solc** repository
- [additional tests](./tests/solidity) written by the **solx** team

## Documentation

**solx** documentation is powered by [GitHub Pages](https://nomicfoundation.github.io/solx/latest/) and provided as an [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook), while its Markdown sources can be found in [this directory](./docs/src/).
To build the book, follow these [instructions](./docs/README.md).

## Installation

For the detailed installation and usage guide, visit [the respective page of our documentation](https://nomicfoundation.github.io/solx/latest/#installation).

## Architecture

**solx** consists of three main parts:

1. **solx** executable from this repository. The repository also contains parts of the compiler front end: Yul and EVM assembly translators.
2. [solx-solidity](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/solx-solidity/), an LLVM-friendly fork of [the Solidity compiler](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity),
  that emits Yul and EVM assembly for **solx**.
3. [solx-llvm](https://github.com/matter-labs/solx-llvm), a fork of [the LLVM project](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project)
  with an EVM target developed by the **solx** team.

The most important part of the project is the EVM target in LLVM. You can find its sources [here](https://github.com/matter-labs/solx-llvm/tree/main/llvm/lib/Target/EVM).

## Testing

To run the unit and CLI tests, execute `cargo test` at the repository root.

## Troubleshooting

If you are building *solx** from source and you have multiple LLVM builds in your system, ensure that you choose the correct one to build the compiler.
The environment variable `LLVM_SYS_211_PREFIX` sets the path to the directory with LLVM build artifacts, which typically ends with `target-llvm/build-final`.
For example:

```shell
export LLVM_SYS_211_PREFIX="${HOME}/src/solx/target-llvm/build-final"
```

If you suspect that the compiler is not using the correct LLVM build, check by running `set | grep LLVM`, and reset all LLVM-related environment variables.

For reference, see [llvm-sys](https://crates.io/crates/llvm-sys) and [Local LLVM Configuration Guide](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#local-llvm-configuration).
